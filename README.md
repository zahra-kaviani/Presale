suppose that a customer asks us to create a token for his/her music website. On his website, any artist can sell his artwork 
and get a token instead. suppose that the consumer wants his token to be mintable and has an initial value.
also, people who stake their tokens and do not Withdraw would get some extra tokens as interest. in the getReward() function, we explained 
this part. also, we designed a Ballot function for users, so that they can vote for songs and find popular artworks.
suppose that the customer wants to raise some funds before launching the project. for this purpose, we designed another contract called 
'presale' for ICO. by using this contract investors can buy tokens before initialising at certain times called "claim".
